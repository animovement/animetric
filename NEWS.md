# animetric 0.3.0

This release brings a re-factoring of the `calculate` and `summarise` functions, along with new `tortuosity` metrics and a bucnh of tests. 
I'm also excited to bring on the first social/collective metric: "Nearest Neighbour Distance" (NND). The calculations are made thoughout the time series with `calculate_nnd()`.
