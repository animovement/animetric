\title{Numerical derivative of arbitrary order}
\usage{
calculate_derivative(x, time, order = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of the same length as \code{time} (e.g., position/distance).}

\item{time}{Numeric, strictly increasing vector of timestamps.}

\item{order}{Positive integer indicating the derivative order (1 = first,
2 = second, …).  Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{length(time)} containing the
\code{order}‑th derivative.
}
\description{
Computes the n‑th derivative of a 1‑D signal \code{x} sampled at timestamps
\code{time}.  The algorithm mirrors \code{xarray.DataArray.differentiate}:
\itemize{
\item forward difference at the first point,
\item central differences for interior points,
\item backward difference at the last point.
The result always has the \strong{same length} as the input vectors.
}
}
\examples{
# Linear motion: x = t  →  1st derivative = 1, 2nd = 0, 3rd = 0 …
t <- 0:5
x <- 0:5
calculate_derivative(x, t, order = 1L)  # => c(1,1,1,1,1,1)
calculate_derivative(x, t, order = 2L)  # => c(0,0,0,0,0,0)
calculate_derivative(x, t, order = 3L)  # => c(0,0,0,0,0,0)
