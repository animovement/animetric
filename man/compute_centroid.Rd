\title{Compute centroid from keypoints}
\usage{
compute_centroid(
  data,
  include_keypoints = NULL,
  exclude_keypoints = NULL,
  centroid_name = "centroid"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An aniframe with Cartesian coordinates (x, y, and/or z columns).}

\item{include_keypoints}{Character vector of keypoints to include in centroid
calculation. If NULL (default), all keypoints are used unless
\code{exclude_keypoints} is specified. Mutually exclusive with \code{exclude_keypoints}.}

\item{exclude_keypoints}{Character vector of keypoints to exclude from centroid
calculation. If NULL (default), no keypoints are excluded. Mutually exclusive
with \code{include_keypoints}.}

\item{centroid_name}{Name for the new centroid keypoint. Default is "centroid".}
}
\value{
An aniframe containing only the centroid keypoint. Coordinate values
are the mean of selected keypoints (with NA values removed). Confidence is
set to NA. Missing coordinate dimensions return NA.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean position of selected keypoints at each time point.
The centroid is computed for each combination of grouping variables
(individual, time, trial/session if present).
