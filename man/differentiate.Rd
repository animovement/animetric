\title{Differentiate a numeric series (optionally repeatedly)}
\usage{
differentiate(x, time = NULL, order = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of observations.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of timestamps.  Must be the same length
as \code{x}.  If \code{NULL}, \code{seq_along(x)} is used.}

\item{order}{Integer ≥ 1 indicating how many times the differentiation
should be applied.  Defaults to a single derivative.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the same length as \code{x} containing the
differentiated values.
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{compute_gradient()} that optionally applies the gradient
operator multiple times (\code{order}).  If no explicit time vector is supplied,
a simple index sequence is used.
}
\details{
The function computes the first‑order derivative using the
Fornberg‑based scheme implemented in \code{compute_gradient()}.  When
\code{order > 1}, the gradient is applied iteratively to the result of the
previous iteration.
}
\examples{
  # Simple equally spaced case
  y <- sin(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 10))
  differentiate(y)

  # Uneven time stamps
  t <- c(0, 0.9, 2.1, 3.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.6, 6.7, 7.2, 8.9)
  differentiate(y, time = t, order = 2)
}
